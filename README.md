 Wolman-Alzheimer Analysis
Dataset:
We have two RSS Feeds to analyze the activities for Wolman dis
ease and Alzheimer disease. I created two data frame one for
Wolman disease and second one for Alzheimer’s disease out of
the data I collected from the give link. Wolman data Frame cons
ists of 10 columns and 10 rows and Alzheimer’s data frame con
sists of 10 columns and 23 rows. I selected 6 columns for my an
alysis i.e ‘title', 'summary', 'summary_detail', 'id', 'published'.
My Analysis:
 As per the given dataset most number of activities for
Wolman Desease are published in the year 2015. the
activities were relatively more before the year 2012 but
gradually dropped to zero and slowly it got high up in the
year 2015 .
 Above plot demonstrate that there are more activities in
September 2020 than in October 2020 related to
Alzheimer disease.
